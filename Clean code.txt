Clean code
Clean code refers to writing code that is easy to understand, maintain, and modify. It follows a set of principles and best practices to make the code more readable and less prone to errors. While there is no definitive document that encompasses all aspects of clean code, there are several resources and books available that provide guidance on writing clean code. Here are some recommended resources:
