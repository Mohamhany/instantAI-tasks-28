Compare among all scheduling algorithms
 Let's compare the three scheduling algorithms: Round Robin, Priority, and First Come First Serve.
1. Round Robin (RR) Scheduling:
* Each process is assigned a fixed time slice (quantum) for execution.
* Processes are executed in a circular manner, with each process getting a turn to run for its allocated time slice.
* If a process doesn't complete within its time slice, it is preempted, and the next process in the queue gets a chance to run.
* RR is typically used in time-sharing systems and provides fairness in terms of CPU time allocation.
* It is easy to implement and ensures that no process starves for execution.
* However, it may not be efficient for long-running processes or when there is a mix of CPU-bound and I/O-bound processes, as it can lead to frequent context switches.
2. Priority Scheduling:
* Each process is assigned a priority value, and the scheduler executes the process with the highest priority first.
* Priority can be based on various factors like process type, importance, deadlines, or user-defined criteria.
* It can be either preemptive or non-preemptive. In preemptive priority scheduling, a higher-priority process can preempt a lower-priority process, while in non-preemptive, once a process starts executing, it continues until completion.
* Priority scheduling is flexible and allows for prioritizing critical tasks or time-sensitive processes.
* However, it can lead to starvation if lower-priority processes never get a chance to execute. To prevent this, aging techniques can be employed to gradually increase the priority of waiting processes.
3. First Come First Serve (FCFS) Scheduling:
* Processes are executed in the order they arrive in the system.
* The first process that arrives gets the CPU first, and subsequent processes wait in a queue.
* FCFS is simple and easy to understand and implement.
* It ensures fairness in terms of order of execution.
* However, FCFS can suffer from the "convoy effect" where a long-running process can hold up the execution of subsequent processes, leading to poor overall system performance.
In summary, here are some key characteristics of each scheduling algorithm:
* Round Robin: Provides fairness, suitable for time-sharing systems, but can have high overhead due to frequent context switches.
* Priority: Allows prioritization of processes based on importance, deadlines, etc., but can lead to starvation if not properly managed.
* First Come First Serve: Simple and ensures fairness in execution order, but can suffer from the convoy effect and may not be suitable for time-sensitive or critical tasks.
